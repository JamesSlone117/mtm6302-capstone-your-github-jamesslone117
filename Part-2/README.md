# Editing Quiz Design Report 


The "Editing Quiz" colour palette is inspired based on Premiere Pro by Adobe video editing software, which has a clean and polished style. The goal was to establish a connection between the quiz interface and the Premiere software to provide editors something that is familiar. 

# Implementation

⁤**Light Background:** The primary background colour for the quiz interface was set to a lighter shade, providing a clean and professional appearance. ⁤


⁤**Contrast and Readability:** To improve readability, a balanced contrast between text and background colours was maintained. Light-colored text is utilized on darker backgrounds for better visibility and reading. ⁤

⁤**Consistency:** The quiz interface uses the select colour scheme for a consistent look, similar to the design of Adobe Premiere Pro. ⁤
