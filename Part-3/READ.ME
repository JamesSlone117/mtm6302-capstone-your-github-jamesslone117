## Introduction

This README.md file documents the development process of the Premiere Quiz project. The project is an interactive quiz for learning video editing in Adobe Premiere Pro. The quiz includes questions about various aspects of video editing, such as file formats, editing techniques, and workflow best practices.

## Workflow

1. **Mobile First**
   - Started with nav and footer, added all pages.
   - Started working on main content buttons, spacing.

2. **Desktop**
   - Adjusted layout for new screen size buttons, nav, footer, images, etc.

3. **Final Touches**
   - Connected the buttons to make the site interactive.
   - Used validator and updated changes.

## Problems

**Footer Alignment:**
- Initially, the footer did not align correctly on different screen sizes.
- To address this, I added the `text-lg-end` class to the footer to align it to the right on large screens.

**Button Layout:**
- The buttons did not change their layout on different screen sizes, leading to inconsistent spacing.
- To fix this, I used Bootstrap's grid system to create a 2x2 grid layout for the buttons on larger screens and a stacked layout for smaller screens.

**Title Alignment:**
- The title of the quiz did not align correctly based on the screen size.
- I resolved this issue by using Bootstrap's text alignment classes to align the title to the left on large screens and center it on smaller screens.
